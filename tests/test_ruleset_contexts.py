# No check-jsonschema hook covers a committed ruleset: the tool ships no schema for one, and a
# `--schemafile <url>` would put the network in `mise run ci`. The shape is asserted here instead,
# because a mis-keyed required-status-checks block leaves the context gates below reading an empty set
# and passing on it. `shape_problem` is the one owner of that shape; the applier refuses on the same
# call, and test_ruleset_decisions.py holds what each refusal says.
#
# Every reader below is pre-flighted, by name against the tree or against a document it is given: a
# reader that silently stops matching reports green over a file full of retired names.

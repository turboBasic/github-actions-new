# turboBasic/github-actions

The navigation layer, shared by every AI coding tool that reads this repository.

This file states no rule. It names each artefact and says what that artefact answers, so a tool told
that "exactly one artefact declares X" can find which one. The rules themselves are two layers above:
the invariants in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, the conventions in `docs/ai-instructions.md`.

Conventionally an `AGENTS.md` carries build commands, code style and test instructions. Those are layer
3 here, and each has an owner in the second table below. Restating one would give this repository two
answers to the same question, which is the arrangement the layering exists to remove.

## The instruction layers

Four layers, the most abstract first.

| # | Layer | Purpose | Stability | Artefacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Invariants | what may never be violated | amended and versioned, rarely | `.specify/memory/constitution.md` |
| 2 | Conventions | how work is done here | edited as practice settles | `docs/ai-instructions.md` |
| 3 | Mechanics | the procedures and the gates | moves with the code | `README.md`, `docs/technical-debt.md`, `tests/`, and the configs below |
| 4 | Navigation | where each fact lives | moves when an artefact does | this file, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |

How each tool reaches the rule layers differs, and layer 4 is where that difference is absorbed.
Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, which imports this file and both rule layers eagerly, in every session.
GitHub Copilot reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and this file directly, has no import mechanism,
and reaches the rule layers by link. Layer 3 is read on demand by both.

## What each layer 3 artefact answers

| Artefact | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` | what this repository is for, and what it currently ships |
| `docs/technical-debt.md` | which shortcuts are deliberate, and the condition that clears each |
| `docs/instruction-layers.md` | the layering itself, explained for another repository to adopt |
| `tests/` | every rule a gate holds |
| `mise.toml` | every tool version, and the task names |
| `pyproject.toml` | the Python dependencies, the tool settings, and the released version |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | the prek hooks |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | which gates run on a pull request |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | what a report or a proposal has to carry |
| `.yamllint.yaml`, `.cspell.config.yaml`, `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, `.taplo.toml` | each linter's own rules and exemptions |
